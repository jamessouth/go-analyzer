// Severity defines how severe a comment is. A sum over all comments of 5 means no approval.
// The maximum for a single comment is 5. A comment with that severity will block approval.
// When assigning the severity a good guideline is to ask: How many comments of similar severity
// should block approval?
// We can be very strict on automated comments since the student has a very fast feedback loop.
